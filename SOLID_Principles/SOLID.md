# SOLID Principles:

## S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. 

[Code](./Single_Responsibility_Principle/SingleResponsibilityPrinciple.java)

## O: Open/Close Principle (OCP):

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. 

[Without applying OCP](./Open_Close_Principle/BeforeOCP.java) | [With OCP](./Open_Close_Principle/AfterOCP.java)

## L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.

[Code](./Liskov_Substitution_Principle/LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple.java)

## I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

No client should be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.

[Code](./Interface_Segregation_Principle/InterfaceSegregationPriciple.java)

## D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
