# SOLID Principles:

## S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

[Code](./SRP/SingleResponsibilityPrinciple.java)

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

## O: Open/Close Principle (OCP):

[Without applying OCP](./OCP/BeforeOCP.java) | [With OCP](./OCP/AfterOCP.java)

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
